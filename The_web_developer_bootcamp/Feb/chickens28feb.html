        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red junglefowl</a>, is a type of domesticated fowl.
        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of
        2018,<sup>[1]</sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011.



        <p>
            Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
            Southeast Asia, and East Asia,<sup>[5]</sup> but the clade found in the Americas,
            Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
            From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in westefrn Asia Minor,
            and to Greece by the 5th century BCE.<sup>[6]</sup> Fowl have been known in Egypt
            since the mid-15th century BCE, with the "bird that gives birth every day"
            having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>Chicken once referred to young domestic fowl in general.
                The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl,
                or just fowl. This use of chicken survives in the phrase
                Hen and Chickens, sometimes used as a British public
                house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large
                and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen
                and Chicken Islands). The "hen and chickens" was also a name for
                the pentacycle, an early design of cargo cycle which had a large
                central driving wheel surrounded by four small stabiliser wheels.</p>

            <h2>General Biology</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>Chickens are omnivores.<sup>[15]</sup> In the wild,
                they often scratch at the soil to search
                for seeds, insects and even animals as large as
                lizards, small snakes,<sup>[16]</sup> or young mice.<sup>[17]</sup>

                The average chicken may live for five to ten years,
                depending on the breed.<sup>[18]</sup> The world's oldest known
                chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age
                of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.<sup>[19]</sup></p>

            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <hr>

            <h4>Social Behaviour</h4>
            <hr>


            <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live
                together in flocks. They have a communal approach to
                the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual
                chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
                "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority
                for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or
                roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to
                this social order until a new pecking order is established.
                Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock
                can lead to fighting and injury.<sup>[20]</sup> When a rooster finds food,
                he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking
                in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour
                may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.</p>
